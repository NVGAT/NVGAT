Hey, I'm NotVeryGoodAtThis. I'm an aspiring 15 year old programmer and content creator. I have a YouTube channel where I make Minecraft content and I know many programming languages.
Some of the programming languages I'm experienced with are Java, JavaScript, C#, C, C++, Rust and Python.
I primairly use my GitHub account to use source control with my Minecraft server plugin. I'm not really active and not looking to be reached,
but if you want to talk to me anyway, you can join my Discord server which is present on my YouTube channel. I respond to DMs pretty quickly and I always have them open.
Hope you have an awesome day!
